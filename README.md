**ROCP** is a modern control panel for *Ragnarok Online* servers based on **rAthena**, built using **Laravel 12**, **Livewire 3**, and **PHP 8.4**.

It‚Äôs designed to be flexible and performant, with optional support for **FrankenPHP** to greatly improve deployment and performance. However, ROCP also works perfectly on traditional stacks with **Nginx + PHP-FPM**.

It uses both **MySQL** and **MongoDB** as data sources and includes a complete Docker setup to run the entire server and connect all components with a single file.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- Full account and character management
- Deep rAthena integration
- Dynamic interface powered by Livewire 3
- Compatible with PHP 8.4, MySQL, MongoDB
- One-command full server setup via Docker
- FrankenPHP support (optional, not required)
